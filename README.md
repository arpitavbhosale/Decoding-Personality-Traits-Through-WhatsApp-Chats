Decoding Personality Traits Through WhatsApp Chats

The project is based on the Big Five Personality Trait Model (OCEAN), which categorizes 
personality into Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. A 
dataset of WhatsApp conversations is collected and preprocessed, including steps like 
tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization. Feature extraction methods 
include TF-IDF vectorization, sentiment analysis using VADER, emoji frequency analysis, 
response time measurement, and active hours tracking to derive meaningful insights from chat 
behavior.
A Random Forest classifier is trained using the extracted features tested for comparison. The 
model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision-recall metrics, and F1-score, with 
Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 98.69%
